## What it does

* Works with Internet Service Provider (ISP) email filtering system that classifies email as spam or not spam.  Develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that detects spam emails.
* Two classification models are fit to the dataset and evaluate which one is more accurate at detecting spam.

## Functions and tasks
* Use of logistic regression model and random forest model.
* Use of split_train_test.
* Use of Standard Scaler.
* Use of logistic regression model.
* Use of Random Forest model.
* Evaluate the two models with accuracy score.

## Conclusion
* It was predicted that Random Forest would be more accurate than Logistic Regression.
* Random Forest works best in non-linear relationships and more complex relationships given the size of X.
* The two accuracy scores were compared.  Random Forest had a slightly higher score althoug both scores exceeded 0.90.
